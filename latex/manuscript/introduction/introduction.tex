\addtextlist{lof}{Preamble}

Detail broadly what generalisation is, to what kind of structures it is applied (neural nets or linear classfier eg). Details on the other hand what optimisation is doing (ERM eg) and explain that interestingly in various methods, reaching minimisers of empirical objectives is enough to ensure a good generalisation ability. From this, discuss about the current limitations of generalisaiton: either not going so often beyound light-tailed assumptions or noticing that the interplays between generalisation (statistical arguments) and optimisation (geometric ones) remains uncharted for a vast range of cases.

CHALLENGE HERE: being very rigorous on the lit review.

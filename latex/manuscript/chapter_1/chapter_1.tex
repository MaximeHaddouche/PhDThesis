\begin{abstract}
    This chapter provides a brief introduction of statistical learning theory and various modern kind of generalisation bounds (go from uniform convergence bounds to algorithmic stability, search for other kinds of non PAC-Bayes bounds). Need to recall the historical and modern shapes of generalisation bounds in ML.

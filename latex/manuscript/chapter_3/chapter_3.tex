\begin{abstract}
Put OPB here. Precise in the intro that the martingale bounds allow to go beyond batch learning but that this has never been made for OL. Put the supermartingale OPB bound in a supplementary section and the Online WPB bound after the main results of OPB to reach heavy-tailed losses.
